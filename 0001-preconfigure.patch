+                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+                       Version 3, 29 June 2007
+
+ Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+                            Preamble
+
+  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
+software and other kinds of works.
+
+  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
+to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
+the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
+share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
+software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
+GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
+any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
+your programs, too.
+
+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
+them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
+want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
+free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
+
+  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
+these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
+certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
+you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
+
+  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
+gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
+freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
+or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
+know their rights.
+
+  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
+(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
+giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
+
+  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
+that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
+authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
+changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
+authors of previous versions.
+
+  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
+modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
+can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
+protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
+pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
+use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
+have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
+products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
+stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
+of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
+
+  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
+States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
+software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
+avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
+make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
+patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
+
+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.
+
+                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+  0. Definitions.
+
+  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
+
+  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
+works, such as semiconductor masks.
+
+  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
+License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
+"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
+
+  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
+in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
+exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
+earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
+
+  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
+on the Program.
+
+  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
+permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
+infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
+computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
+distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
+public, and in some countries other activities as well.
+
+  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
+parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
+a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
+
+  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
+to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
+feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
+tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
+extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
+work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
+the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
+menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
+
+  1. Source Code.
+
+  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
+for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
+form of a work.
+
+  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
+standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
+interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
+is widely used among developers working in that language.
+
+  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
+than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
+packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
+Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
+Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
+implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
+"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
+(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
+(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
+produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
+
+  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
+the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
+work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
+control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
+System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
+programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
+which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
+includes interface definition files associated with source files for
+the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
+linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
+such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
+subprograms and other parts of the work.
+
+  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
+can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
+Source.
+
+  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
+same work.
+
+  2. Basic Permissions.
+
+  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
+copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
+conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
+permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
+covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
+content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
+rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
+
+  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
+convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
+in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
+of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
+with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
+the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
+not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
+for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
+and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
+your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
+
+  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
+the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
+makes it unnecessary.
+
+  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
+
+  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
+measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
+11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
+similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
+measures.
+
+  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
+circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
+is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
+the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
+modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
+users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
+technological measures.
+
+  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
+
+  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
+receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
+appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
+keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
+non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
+keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
+recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
+
+  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
+and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
+
+  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
+
+  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
+produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
+terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
+    it, and giving a relevant date.
+
+    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
+    released under this License and any conditions added under section
+    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
+    "keep intact all notices".
+
+    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
+    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
+    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
+    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
+    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
+    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
+    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
+
+    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
+    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
+    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
+    work need not make them do so.
+
+  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
+works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
+and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
+in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
+"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
+used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
+beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
+in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
+parts of the aggregate.
+
+  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
+
+  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
+of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
+machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
+in one of these ways:
+
+    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
+    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
+    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
+    customarily used for software interchange.
+
+    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
+    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
+    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
+    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
+    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
+    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
+    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
+    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
+    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
+    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
+    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
+
+    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
+    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
+    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
+    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
+    with subsection 6b.
+
+    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
+    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
+    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
+    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
+    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
+    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
+    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
+    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
+    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
+    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
+    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
+    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
+
+    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
+    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
+    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
+    charge under subsection 6d.
+
+  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
+from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
+included in conveying the object code work.
+
+  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
+tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
+or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
+into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
+doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
+product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
+typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
+of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
+actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
+is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
+commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
+the only significant mode of use of the product.
+
+  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
+procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
+and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
+a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
+suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
+code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
+modification has been made.
+
+  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
+specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
+part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
+User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
+fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
+Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
+by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
+if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
+modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
+been installed in ROM).
+
+  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
+requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
+for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
+the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
+network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
+adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
+protocols for communication across the network.
+
+  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
+in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
+documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
+source code form), and must require no special password or key for
+unpacking, reading or copying.
+
+  7. Additional Terms.
+
+  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
+License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
+Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
+be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
+that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
+apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
+under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
+this License without regard to the additional permissions.
+
+  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
+remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
+it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
+removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
+additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
+for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
+
+  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
+add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
+that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
+
+    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
+    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
+
+    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
+    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
+    Notices displayed by works containing it; or
+
+    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
+    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
+    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
+
+    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
+    authors of the material; or
+
+    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
+    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
+
+    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
+    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
+    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
+    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
+    those licensors and authors.
+
+  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
+restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
+received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
+governed by this License along with a term that is a further
+restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
+a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
+License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
+of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
+not survive such relicensing or conveying.
+
+  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
+must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
+additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
+where to find the applicable terms.
+
+  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
+form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
+the above requirements apply either way.
+
+  8. Termination.
+
+  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
+provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
+modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
+this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
+paragraph of section 11).
+
+  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
+license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
+provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
+finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
+holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
+prior to 60 days after the cessation.
+
+  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
+reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
+violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
+received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
+copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
+your receipt of the notice.
+
+  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
+licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
+this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
+reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
+material under section 10.
+
+  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
+
+  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
+run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
+occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
+to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
+nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
+modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
+not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
+covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
+
+  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
+
+  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
+receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
+propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
+for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
+
+  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
+organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
+organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
+work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
+transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
+licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
+give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
+Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
+the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
+
+  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
+rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
+not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
+rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
+(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
+any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
+sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
+
+  11. Patents.
+
+  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
+License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
+work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
+
+  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
+owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
+hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
+by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
+but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
+consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
+purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
+patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
+this License.
+
+  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
+patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
+make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
+propagate the contents of its contributor version.
+
+  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
+agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
+(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
+sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
+party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
+patent against the party.
+
+  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
+and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
+to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
+publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
+then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
+available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
+patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
+consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
+license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
+actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
+covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
+in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
+country that you have reason to believe are valid.
+
+  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
+arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
+covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
+receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
+or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
+you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
+work and works based on it.
+
+  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
+the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
+conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
+specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
+work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
+in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
+to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
+the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
+parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
+patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
+conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
+for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
+contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
+or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
+
+  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
+any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
+otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
+
+  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
+
+  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
+covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
+not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
+to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
+the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
+License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
+
+  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
+
+  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
+permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
+under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
+combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
+License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
+but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
+section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
+combination as such.
+
+  14. Revised Versions of this License.
+
+  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
+the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
+be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
+address new problems or concerns.
+
+  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
+Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
+Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
+option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
+version or of any later version published by the Free Software
+Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
+GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
+by the Free Software Foundation.
+
+  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
+versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
+public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
+to choose that version for the Program.
+
+  Later license versions may give you additional or different
+permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
+author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
+later version.
+
+  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
+

+
+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
+
+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
+the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

+
+Basic Installation
+==================
+
+   Briefly, the shell command './configure && make && make install'
+should configure, build, and install this package.  The following
+more-detailed instructions are generic; see the 'README' file for
+instructions specific to this package.  Some packages provide this
+'INSTALL' file but do not implement all of the features documented
+below.  The lack of an optional feature in a given package is not
+necessarily a bug.  More recommendations for GNU packages can be found
+in *note Makefile Conventions: (standards)Makefile Conventions.
+
+   The 'configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
+various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
+those values to create a 'Makefile' in each directory of the package.
+It may also create one or more '.h' files containing system-dependent
+definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script 'config.status' that
+you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
+file 'config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for
+debugging 'configure').
+
+   It can also use an optional file (typically called 'config.cache' and
+enabled with '--cache-file=config.cache' or simply '-C') that saves the
+results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  Caching is disabled by
+default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale cache files.
+
+   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
+to figure out how 'configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
+diffs or instructions to the address given in the 'README' so they can
+be considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at
+some point 'config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you
+may remove or edit it.
+
+   The file 'configure.ac' (or 'configure.in') is used to create
+'configure' by a program called 'autoconf'.  You need 'configure.ac' if
+you want to change it or regenerate 'configure' using a newer version of
+'autoconf'.
+
+   The simplest way to compile this package is:
+
+  1. 'cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
+     './configure' to configure the package for your system.
+
+     Running 'configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints
+     some messages telling which features it is checking for.
+
+  2. Type 'make' to compile the package.
+
+  3. Optionally, type 'make check' to run any self-tests that come with
+     the package, generally using the just-built uninstalled binaries.
+
+  4. Type 'make install' to install the programs and any data files and
+     documentation.  When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is
+     recommended that the package be configured and built as a regular
+     user, and only the 'make install' phase executed with root
+     privileges.
+
+  5. Optionally, type 'make installcheck' to repeat any self-tests, but
+     this time using the binaries in their final installed location.
+     This target does not install anything.  Running this target as a
+     regular user, particularly if the prior 'make install' required
+     root privileges, verifies that the installation completed
+     correctly.
+
+  6. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
+     source code directory by typing 'make clean'.  To also remove the
+     files that 'configure' created (so you can compile the package for
+     a different kind of computer), type 'make distclean'.  There is
+     also a 'make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
+     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
+     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
+     with the distribution.
+
+  7. Often, you can also type 'make uninstall' to remove the installed
+     files again.  In practice, not all packages have tested that
+     uninstallation works correctly, even though it is required by the
+     GNU Coding Standards.
+
+  8. Some packages, particularly those that use Automake, provide 'make
+     distcheck', which can by used by developers to test that all other
+     targets like 'make install' and 'make uninstall' work correctly.
+     This target is generally not run by end users.
+
+Compilers and Options
+=====================
+
+   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
+the 'configure' script does not know about.  Run './configure --help'
+for details on some of the pertinent environment variables.
+
+   You can give 'configure' initial values for configuration parameters
+by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here is
+an example:
+
+     ./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix
+
+   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.
+
+Compiling For Multiple Architectures
+====================================
+
+   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
+same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
+own directory.  To do this, you can use GNU 'make'.  'cd' to the
+directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
+the 'configure' script.  'configure' automatically checks for the source
+code in the directory that 'configure' is in and in '..'.  This is known
+as a "VPATH" build.
+
+   With a non-GNU 'make', it is safer to compile the package for one
+architecture at a time in the source code directory.  After you have
+installed the package for one architecture, use 'make distclean' before
+reconfiguring for another architecture.
+
+   On MacOS X 10.5 and later systems, you can create libraries and
+executables that work on multiple system types--known as "fat" or
+"universal" binaries--by specifying multiple '-arch' options to the
+compiler but only a single '-arch' option to the preprocessor.  Like
+this:
+
+     ./configure CC="gcc -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
+                 CXX="g++ -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
+                 CPP="gcc -E" CXXCPP="g++ -E"
+
+   This is not guaranteed to produce working output in all cases, you
+may have to build one architecture at a time and combine the results
+using the 'lipo' tool if you have problems.
+
+Installation Names
+==================
+
+   By default, 'make install' installs the package's commands under
+'/usr/local/bin', include files under '/usr/local/include', etc.  You
+can specify an installation prefix other than '/usr/local' by giving
+'configure' the option '--prefix=PREFIX', where PREFIX must be an
+absolute file name.
+
+   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
+architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
+pass the option '--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to 'configure', the package uses
+PREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
+Documentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.
+
+   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
+options like '--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular
+kinds of files.  Run 'configure --help' for a list of the directories
+you can set and what kinds of files go in them.  In general, the default
+for these options is expressed in terms of '${prefix}', so that
+specifying just '--prefix' will affect all of the other directory
+specifications that were not explicitly provided.
+
+   The most portable way to affect installation locations is to pass the
+correct locations to 'configure'; however, many packages provide one or
+both of the following shortcuts of passing variable assignments to the
+'make install' command line to change installation locations without
+having to reconfigure or recompile.
+
+   The first method involves providing an override variable for each
+affected directory.  For example, 'make install
+prefix=/alternate/directory' will choose an alternate location for all
+directory configuration variables that were expressed in terms of
+'${prefix}'.  Any directories that were specified during 'configure',
+but not in terms of '${prefix}', must each be overridden at install time
+for the entire installation to be relocated.  The approach of makefile
+variable overrides for each directory variable is required by the GNU
+Coding Standards, and ideally causes no recompilation.  However, some
+platforms have known limitations with the semantics of shared libraries
+that end up requiring recompilation when using this method, particularly
+noticeable in packages that use GNU Libtool.
+
+   The second method involves providing the 'DESTDIR' variable.  For
+example, 'make install DESTDIR=/alternate/directory' will prepend
+'/alternate/directory' before all installation names.  The approach of
+'DESTDIR' overrides is not required by the GNU Coding Standards, and
+does not work on platforms that have drive letters.  On the other hand,
+it does better at avoiding recompilation issues, and works well even
+when some directory options were not specified in terms of '${prefix}'
+at 'configure' time.
+
+Optional Features
+=================
+
+   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
+with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving 'configure' the
+option '--program-prefix=PREFIX' or '--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.
+
+   Some packages pay attention to '--enable-FEATURE' options to
+'configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
+They may also pay attention to '--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
+is something like 'gnu-as' or 'x' (for the X Window System).  The
+'README' should mention any '--enable-' and '--with-' options that the
+package recognizes.
+
+   For packages that use the X Window System, 'configure' can usually
+find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
+you can use the 'configure' options '--x-includes=DIR' and
+'--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.
+
+   Some packages offer the ability to configure how verbose the
+execution of 'make' will be.  For these packages, running './configure
+--enable-silent-rules' sets the default to minimal output, which can be
+overridden with 'make V=1'; while running './configure
+--disable-silent-rules' sets the default to verbose, which can be
+overridden with 'make V=0'.
+
+Particular systems
+==================
+
+   On HP-UX, the default C compiler is not ANSI C compatible.  If GNU CC
+is not installed, it is recommended to use the following options in
+order to use an ANSI C compiler:
+
+     ./configure CC="cc -Ae -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500"
+
+and if that doesn't work, install pre-built binaries of GCC for HP-UX.
+
+   HP-UX 'make' updates targets which have the same time stamps as their
+prerequisites, which makes it generally unusable when shipped generated
+files such as 'configure' are involved.  Use GNU 'make' instead.
+
+   On OSF/1 a.k.a. Tru64, some versions of the default C compiler cannot
+parse its '<wchar.h>' header file.  The option '-nodtk' can be used as a
+workaround.  If GNU CC is not installed, it is therefore recommended to
+try
+
+     ./configure CC="cc"
+
+and if that doesn't work, try
+
+     ./configure CC="cc -nodtk"
+
+   On Solaris, don't put '/usr/ucb' early in your 'PATH'.  This
+directory contains several dysfunctional programs; working variants of
+these programs are available in '/usr/bin'.  So, if you need '/usr/ucb'
+in your 'PATH', put it _after_ '/usr/bin'.
+
+   On Haiku, software installed for all users goes in '/boot/common',
+not '/usr/local'.  It is recommended to use the following options:
+
+     ./configure --prefix=/boot/common
+
+Specifying the System Type
+==========================
+
+   There may be some features 'configure' cannot figure out
+automatically, but needs to determine by the type of machine the package
+will run on.  Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the
+_same_ architectures, 'configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
+a message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the
+'--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
+type, such as 'sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:
+
+     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM
+
+where SYSTEM can have one of these forms:
+
+     OS
+     KERNEL-OS
+
+   See the file 'config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
+'config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
+need to know the machine type.
+
+   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should
+use the option '--target=TYPE' to select the type of system they will
+produce code for.
+
+   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a
+platform different from the build platform, you should specify the
+"host" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will
+eventually be run) with '--host=TYPE'.
+
+Sharing Defaults
+================
+
+   If you want to set default values for 'configure' scripts to share,
+you can create a site shell script called 'config.site' that gives
+default values for variables like 'CC', 'cache_file', and 'prefix'.
+'configure' looks for 'PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
+'PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
+'CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
+A warning: not all 'configure' scripts look for a site script.
+
+Defining Variables
+==================
+
+   Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
+environment passed to 'configure'.  However, some packages may run
+configure again during the build, and the customized values of these
+variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set
+them in the 'configure' command line, using 'VAR=value'.  For example:
+
+     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc
+
+causes the specified 'gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is
+overridden in the site shell script).
+
+Unfortunately, this technique does not work for 'CONFIG_SHELL' due to an
+Autoconf limitation.  Until the limitation is lifted, you can use this
+workaround:
+
+     CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash ./configure CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash
+
+'configure' Invocation
+======================
+
+   'configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
+operates.
+
+'--help'
+'-h'
+     Print a summary of all of the options to 'configure', and exit.
+
+'--help=short'
+'--help=recursive'
+     Print a summary of the options unique to this package's
+     'configure', and exit.  The 'short' variant lists options used only
+     in the top level, while the 'recursive' variant lists options also
+     present in any nested packages.
+
+'--version'
+'-V'
+     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the 'configure'
+     script, and exit.
+
+'--cache-file=FILE'
+     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
+     traditionally 'config.cache'.  FILE defaults to '/dev/null' to
+     disable caching.
+
+'--config-cache'
+'-C'
+     Alias for '--cache-file=config.cache'.
+
+'--quiet'
+'--silent'
+'-q'
+     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
+     suppress all normal output, redirect it to '/dev/null' (any error
+     messages will still be shown).
+
+'--srcdir=DIR'
+     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
+     'configure' can determine that directory automatically.
+
+'--prefix=DIR'
+     Use DIR as the installation prefix.  *note Installation Names:: for
+     more details, including other options available for fine-tuning the
+     installation locations.
+
+'--no-create'
+'-n'
+     Run the configure checks, but stop before creating any output
+     files.
+
+'configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
+'configure --help' for more details.

+# For projects using AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([foo]), Autoconf sets
+# $ac_aux_dir to '$srcdir/foo'.  In other projects, it is set to
+# '$srcdir', '$srcdir/..', or '$srcdir/../..'.
+#
+# Of course, Automake must honor this variable whenever it calls a
+# tool from the auxiliary directory.  The problem is that $srcdir (and
+# therefore $ac_aux_dir as well) can be either absolute or relative,
+# depending on how configure is run.  This is pretty annoying, since
+# it makes $ac_aux_dir quite unusable in subdirectories: in the top
+# source directory, any form will work fine, but in subdirectories a
+# relative path needs to be adjusted first.
+#
+# $ac_aux_dir/missing
+#    fails when called from a subdirectory if $ac_aux_dir is relative
+# $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing
+#    fails if $ac_aux_dir is absolute,
+#    fails when called from a subdirectory in a VPATH build with
+#          a relative $ac_aux_dir
+#
+# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir
+# are both prefixed by $srcdir.  In an in-source build this is usually
+# harmless because $srcdir is '.', but things will broke when you
+# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.
+#
+# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,
+# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.  That would be:
+#   am_aux_dir='\$(top_srcdir)/'`expr "$ac_aux_dir" : "$srcdir//*\(.*\)"`
+# and then we would define $MISSING as
+#   MISSING="\${SHELL} $am_aux_dir/missing"
+# This will work as long as MISSING is not called from configure, because
+# unfortunately $(top_srcdir) has no meaning in configure.
+# However there are other variables, like CC, which are often used in
+# configure, and could therefore not use this "fixed" $ac_aux_dir.
+#
+# Another solution, used here, is to always expand $ac_aux_dir to an

+\`configure' configures iio-sensor-proxy 3.0 to adapt to many kinds of systems.
+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
+
+Installation directories:
+  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
+                          @<:@@S|@ac_default_prefix@:>@
+  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
+                          @<:@PREFIX@:>@
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
+
+For better control, use the options below.
+
+Fine tuning of the installation directories:
+  --bindir=DIR            user executables [EPREFIX/bin]
+  --sbindir=DIR           system admin executables [EPREFIX/sbin]
+  --libexecdir=DIR        program executables [EPREFIX/libexec]

+  --localstatedir=DIR     modifiable single-machine data [PREFIX/var]
+  --libdir=DIR            object code libraries [EPREFIX/lib]
+  --includedir=DIR        C header files [PREFIX/include]
+  --oldincludedir=DIR     C header files for non-gcc [/usr/include]
+  --datarootdir=DIR       read-only arch.-independent data root [PREFIX/share]

+  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
+  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
+              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
+  LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l<library>
+  CPPFLAGS    (Objective) C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if
+              you have headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
+
+Use these variables to override the choices made by `configure' or to help
+it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.

+\`configure' configures iio-sensor-proxy 3.0 to adapt to many kinds of systems.
+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
+
+Installation directories:
+  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
+                          @<:@@S|@ac_default_prefix@:>@
+  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
+                          @<:@PREFIX@:>@
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
+
+For better control, use the options below.

+\`configure' configures iio-sensor-proxy 3.0 to adapt to many kinds of systems.
+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
+
+Installation directories:

+  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
+                          @<:@PREFIX@:>@
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
+
+For better control, use the options below.

+# This file is supposed to be the same for all GNU packages

+# Each package is responsible for reporting which valid configurations

+# a failure to support a valid configuration from a meaningless
+# configuration.
+
+# The goal of this file is to map all the various variations of a given
+# machine specification into a single specification in the form:
+#	CPU_TYPE-MANUFACTURER-OPERATING_SYSTEM
+# or in some cases, the newer four-part form:
+#	CPU_TYPE-MANUFACTURER-KERNEL-OPERATING_SYSTEM
+# It is wrong to echo any other type of specification.

+##   -MM, not -M (despite what the docs say).  Also, it might not be
+##   supported by the other compilers which use the 'gcc' depmode.
+## - Using -M directly means running the compiler twice (even worse

+## is deleted, the dependency causes make to die (because there is
+## typically no way to rebuild the header).  We avoid this by adding
+## dummy dependencies for each header file.  Too bad gcc doesn't do
+## this for us directly.
+## Some versions of gcc put a space before the ':'.  On the theory
+## that the space means something, we add a space to the output as
+## well.  hp depmode also adds that space, but also prefixes the VPATH

+\`configure' configures iio-sensor-proxy 3.0 to adapt to many kinds of systems.
+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
+
+Installation directories:
+  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX

+  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
+                          [PREFIX]
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
+
+For better control, use the options below.

+#
+#   For every FLAG1, FLAG2 it is checked whether the compiler works with the

+#
+#   If FLAGS-VARIABLE is not specified, the current language's flags (e.g.

+#   If EXTRA-FLAGS is defined, it is added to the current language's default

+#   AX_COMPILER_FLAGS([CFLAGS-VARIABLE], [LDFLAGS-VARIABLE], [IS-RELEASE], [EXTRA-BASE-CFLAGS], [EXTRA-YES-CFLAGS], [UNUSED], [UNUSED], [UNUSED], [EXTRA-BASE-LDFLAGS], [EXTRA-YES-LDFLAGS], [UNUSED], [UNUSED], [UNUSED])
+#
+# DESCRIPTION
+#
+#   Check for the presence of an --enable-compile-warnings option to
+#   configure, defaulting to "error" in normal operation, or "yes" if
+#   IS-RELEASE is equal to "yes".  Return the value in the variable
+#   $ax_enable_compile_warnings.
+#
+#   Depending on the value of --enable-compile-warnings, different compiler
+#   warnings are checked to see if they work with the current compiler and,
+#   if so, are appended to CFLAGS-VARIABLE and LDFLAGS-VARIABLE.  This
+#   allows a consistent set of baseline compiler warnings to be used across
+#   a code base, irrespective of any warnings enabled locally by individual
+#   developers.  By standardising the warnings used by all developers of a
+#   project, the project can commit to a zero-warnings policy, using -Werror
+#   to prevent compilation if new warnings are introduced.  This makes
+#   catching bugs which are flagged by warnings a lot easier.
+#
+#   By providing a consistent --enable-compile-warnings argument across all
+#   projects using this macro, continuous integration systems can easily be
+#   configured the same for all projects.  Automated systems or build
+#   systems aimed at beginners may want to pass the --disable-Werror
+#   argument to unconditionally prevent warnings being fatal.
+#
+#   --enable-compile-warnings can take the values:
+#
+#    * no:      Base compiler warnings only; not even -Wall.
+#    * yes:     The above, plus a broad range of useful warnings.
+#    * error:   The above, plus -Werror so that all warnings are fatal.
+#               Use --disable-Werror to override this and disable fatal
+#               warnings.
+#
+#   The set of base and enabled flags can be augmented using the
+#   EXTRA-*-CFLAGS and EXTRA-*-LDFLAGS variables, which are tested and
+#   appended to the output variable if --enable-compile-warnings is not
+#   "no". Flags should not be disabled using these arguments, as the entire
+#   point of AX_COMPILER_FLAGS is to enforce a consistent set of useful
+#   compiler warnings on code, using warnings which have been chosen for low
+#   false positive rates.  If a compiler emits false positives for a
+#   warning, a #pragma should be used in the code to disable the warning
+#   locally. See:
+#
+#     https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.9.2/gcc/Diagnostic-Pragmas.html#Diagnostic-Pragmas
+#
+#   The EXTRA-* variables should only be used to supply extra warning flags,
+#   and not general purpose compiler flags, as they are controlled by
+#   configure options such as --disable-Werror.
+#
+#   IS-RELEASE can be used to disable -Werror when making a release, which
+#   is useful for those hairy moments when you just want to get the release
+#   done as quickly as possible.  Set it to "yes" to disable -Werror. By
+#   default, it uses the value of $ax_is_release, so if you are using the
+#   AX_IS_RELEASE macro, there is no need to pass this parameter. For
+#   example:
+#
+#     AX_IS_RELEASE([git-directory])
+#     AX_COMPILER_FLAGS()
+#
+#   CFLAGS-VARIABLE defaults to WARN_CFLAGS, and LDFLAGS-VARIABLE defaults
+#   to WARN_LDFLAGS.  Both variables are AC_SUBST-ed by this macro, but must
+#   be manually added to the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS variables for each target in
+#   the code base.
+#
+#   If C++ language support is enabled with AC_PROG_CXX, which must occur
+#   before this macro in configure.ac, warning flags for the C++ compiler
+#   are AC_SUBST-ed as WARN_CXXFLAGS, and must be manually added to the
+#   CXXFLAGS variables for each target in the code base.  EXTRA-*-CFLAGS can
+#   be used to augment the base and enabled flags.
+#
+#   Warning flags for g-ir-scanner (from GObject Introspection) are
+#   AC_SUBST-ed as WARN_SCANNERFLAGS.  This variable must be manually added
+#   to the SCANNERFLAGS variable for each GIR target in the code base.  If
+#   extra g-ir-scanner flags need to be enabled, the AX_COMPILER_FLAGS_GIR
+#   macro must be invoked manually.
+#
+#   AX_COMPILER_FLAGS may add support for other tools in future, in addition
+#   to the compiler and linker.  No extra EXTRA-* variables will be added
+#   for those tools, and all extra support will still use the single
+#   --enable-compile-warnings configure option.  For finer grained control
+#   over the flags for individual tools, use AX_COMPILER_FLAGS_CFLAGS,
+#   AX_COMPILER_FLAGS_LDFLAGS and AX_COMPILER_FLAGS_* for new tools.
+#
+#   The UNUSED variables date from a previous version of this macro, and are
+#   automatically appended to the preceding non-UNUSED variable. They should
+#   be left empty in new uses of the macro.

+# SYNOPSIS
+#
+#   AX_IS_RELEASE(POLICY)
+#
+# DESCRIPTION
+#
+#   Determine whether the code is being configured as a release, or from
+#   git. Set the ax_is_release variable to 'yes' or 'no'.
+#
+#   If building a release version, it is recommended that the configure
+#   script disable compiler errors and debug features, by conditionalising
+#   them on the ax_is_release variable.  If building from git, these
+#   features should be enabled.
+#
+#   The POLICY parameter specifies how ax_is_release is determined. It can
+#   take the following values:
+#
+#    * git-directory:  ax_is_release will be 'no' if a '.git' directory exists
+#    * minor-version:  ax_is_release will be 'no' if the minor version number
+#                      in $PACKAGE_VERSION is odd; this assumes
+#                      $PACKAGE_VERSION follows the 'major.minor.micro' scheme
+#    * micro-version:  ax_is_release will be 'no' if the micro version number
+#                      in $PACKAGE_VERSION is odd; this assumes
+#                      $PACKAGE_VERSION follows the 'major.minor.micro' scheme
+#    * dash-version:   ax_is_release will be 'no' if there is a dash '-'
+#                      in $PACKAGE_VERSION, for example 1.2-pre3, 1.2.42-a8b9
+#                      or 2.0-dirty (in particular this is suitable for use
+#                      with git-version-gen)
+#    * always:         ax_is_release will always be 'yes'
+#    * never:          ax_is_release will always be 'no'
+#
+#   Other policies may be added in future.

+# SYNOPSIS
+#
+#   AX_REQUIRE_DEFINED(MACRO)
+#
+# DESCRIPTION
+#
+#   AX_REQUIRE_DEFINED is a simple helper for making sure other macros have
+#   been defined and thus are available for use.  This avoids random issues
+#   where a macro isn't expanded.  Instead the configure script emits a
+#   non-fatal:
+#
+#     ./configure: line 1673: AX_CFLAGS_WARN_ALL: command not found
+#
+#   It's like AC_REQUIRE except it doesn't expand the required macro.
+#
+#   Here's an example:
+#
+#     AX_REQUIRE_DEFINED([AX_CHECK_LINK_FLAG])
